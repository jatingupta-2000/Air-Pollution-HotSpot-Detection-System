<h1> Air pollution Hotspots Detection Using time series forcasting methods .
  
 •	Developed fully responsive web application which detect the Air pollution hotspots by calculating the Air Quality Index (AQI) and using real time series forecasting methods.
•	We classify the hotspot based in the three different features based on the values of NO2, SO2, and SPM.
•	Uses different machine learning model like ARIMA and Seasonal ARIMA for the hotspot detection.
